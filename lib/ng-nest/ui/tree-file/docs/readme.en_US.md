# TreeFile

The tree directory displays the file contents.

> The component directly relies on the highlighted component `Highlight` in the code, and a dependency of `prismjs` needs to be added. When using it, you need to manually add the corresponding dependency in `angular.json`. You can refer to the configuration of `angular.json` for `prismjs` in the `ng-nest` source code.
