# NG-NEST

NG-NEST is an open source Web application framework based on Angular and NEST, mainly used for research and development of enterprise-level background products.

- [Angular](https://angular.dev/overview) is an application design framework and development platform for creating efficient, complex, sophisticated, single-page applications.
- [Nest](https://docs.nestjs.com/) is a framework for building efficient, scalable Node.js server-side applications.

## Features
